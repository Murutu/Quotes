# Quotes

An Angular Js App that allows users to create and delete quotes. It also allows users to vote on posted quotes, and see the number of votes that quotes have.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
